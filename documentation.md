### Component Interactions

The system components interact as follows:

1. The **API Connections Framework** provides the foundation for all external API communications, including AI models and social media platforms.

2. The **Social Media Integration** module uses the API Connections Framework to interact with social media platforms and manage user accounts.

3. The **News Analysis Engine** fetches news data and uses the Social Media Integration module to gather social media trends for comprehensive analysis.

4. The **Frequency Generator** creates frequency patterns from text and can communicate with AI models through the API Connections Framework.

5. The **User Interface** integrates all these components into a cohesive, user-friendly interface.
